    GradInput uses the gradient of a target y w.r.t its input and multiplies it

    atom can be interpreted as a measure of how much the atom needs to be changed
    to least affect the target. Same for edges. The sign gives indication if
    this change is positive or negative. In this sense the gradient is interpreted
    as a measure of importance of each component in the input. An equation for
    this method is:
